# 1. Print only the odd numbers from 1 to 100 using for loop.
# 2. Number guess game: Make a variable named 'correct_number'. Store some integer in it.
# Then, take guesses from user and match it with 'correct_number'. Let the user guess upto 3 times if incorrect guess is made.
# If the guess is correct, stop the program. Use While loop.

# 3. Print the following pattern using nested loop: 
# * 
# ** 
# *** 
# **** 
# ***** 

# 4. Write a program to calculate the sum of even numbers between 1 and 10. 
# 5. Write a program to print numbers in reverse order from 10 to 1.
# 6. Write a program to print the powers of 2 from `2^1` to `2^10`. 

# 1. Print only the odd numbers from 1 to 100 using for loop.
